1.0.15
- little compatibility fix suggested by jptrrs (for Human Resources mod);

1.0.14
- updated for 1.2;

1.0.13
- made changes that should remove slowdown when selecting a lot of items at the same time. Not effective if you select a lot of items of different types though. That's a sacrifice that must be done, I guess;

1.0.12
- added options to hide designations when they're not usable;

1.0.11
- together with Samboy figured out an issue behind incompatibility with BetterLoading. Should be working now.

1.0.10
- updated how icons are drawn. Now buttons don't get disfigured by wrong scaling, icons get a picture of currently existing building on the map (or no icon if there is no building). I wish I could do something about designation markers;
- fixed designations getting removed the same moment a pawn decides to do anything with a designated item. Bug was added with Rimword 1.1 update;

1.0.9
- officially added Harmony dependency;

1.0.8
- accidentally fixed mechanics that I was making for Mend & Recycle, and other mods with that kind of special jobs, but didn't finish. So it works now, I guess?
- fixed a problem, due to which designation wouldn't be removed after job is done;

1.0.7
- updated for RW 1.1;

1.0.6
- added some paranoid checks for better mod compatibility;

1.0.5
- fixed an issue that caused an error when MicroDesignations, Hospitality and Medical Supplements are used together;

1.0.4
- added extra reservation check to avoid "no job" error;

1.0.2
- dramatically reduced, how much calculations must be done to check if designation is available for exact item, significantly reducing possible lag in games with massive amount of content adding mods;

1.0.1
- fixed filtering issue that allowed rotting corpses to be butchered;
- fixed filtering issue that disallowed cremation of animal corpses.

1.0.0
- happy release day!
